    "# Background Knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a species, we are surprisingly fragile in the face of natural perils like hailstorms, floods, and high winds.  As a result, we have developed the built environment to largely separate us from normal variations in temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, rain, and lightning.  However, the use of the phrase \"normal\" variations should underscore the statistical nature of these phenomenon.  Every year, natural disasters occur on every continent on this planet.  Many go unnoticed, as they occur in undeveloped regions on the planet.  However, when these events do intersect with the built environment, they test the limitations of our infrastructure.  Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and many other natural perils significantly impact a large number of structures whenever they pass over developed regions. Due to the rarity of these events and the expense of constructing indestructable structures, buildings are rarely designed to accomodate the conditions that occur during these events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most engineered structures are developed with design criterion that specifically reference the occurance rate of these events, e.g., 100 year storms, 1000 year floods, 10000 year earthquakes, etc.   Building structures to withstand stressful events requires an increase in design time and an increase in materials and labor, which ultimately creates a situation that requires a tradeoff: safety versus development cost.  From an engineering perspective, the useful lifecycle of a building can be quantified in decades, whereas the occurance rate for large natural disasters is typically quantified in centuries or even millennia.  Thus, we are really making a decision under uncertainty: what is the probability that my structure will undergo the  conditions that occur during a category five hurricane for example.  Many people look at the odds, decide their lifespan is short and wallet light, and gamble on the construction quality of their homes.  Thus, the insurance industry arose to manage the risk incurred due to optimistic construction codes and homebuyers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Policy makers depend on these estimates to make recommendations on building codes: i.e., the minimum structural properties required for a building to be considered safe to occupy.  However, due to the importance of these structures in our lives, people often hedge their bets by purchasing insurance against natural disasters, and in turn, the insurance companies need to quantify these event probabilies in order to price their policies correctly.  In the early eighties and nineties, these probabilities were estimated from very limited datasets.  However, with the advent of satellite imagery, sophisicated measurement devices, and large scale data collection and processing, the ability to quantify this uncertainty has improved significantly.  Entire companies have been developed who model the natural disasters using state of the art physics models, machine learning, data visualization techniques, and physical experiments.  Still, the infrequent nature of these disasters leaves much room for uncertainty, and the computational cost associated with the modeling stage makes it difficult to know if the statistics that we compute from these simulations have converged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Especially challenging is the fact that the scales that these events occur on vary drastically, and the insurance policies which a company wishes to sell operate on scales as small as individual houses, and as large as worldwide corporate policies.  For instance, we may be able to model the probability of having ten or more hurricanes in the Atlantic basin during a single season, but how well are we modeling the probability of a category five earthquake making landfall on a specific city along the South Carolina coastline.  The idea is that the smaller the scale that we consider, the lower the probability of an event occuring on that specific spot, and the less frequently a specific event occurs, the harder it is to estimate the probability that the event will occur.  Assessing the quality of these estimates is the purpose of this document.\n"

    "This notebook is being developed to assess the convergence criterion for the stochastic catalogs developed by A.I.R.  This is a test dataset which is used for assessing coding skills, and does not represent actual datasets used by the company.  The data used for this exercise have been separated into several files.  These datasets need to be reduced to the relevant information for our analysis, and then joined into a single dataset for processing.  The requirements of this process are simply to be able to process the data on a single work pc with 16 GB of memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Loss statistics, i.e., how statistics that estimate much money an insurance company might lose in a single year, are estimated using mathematical models of individual natural disasters.  For example, a company may have separate models for earthquakes in the United States, typhoons in Japan, and landslides in China.  This spatial discretization is extremely necessary due to the physical nature of the events; a hurricane is extremely unlikely to occur in northern Canada compared to southern Florida in the US.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loss statistics are computed from stochastic catalogs, which are Monte Carlo style simulations that account for uncertainty in the model parameters: frequency of events, location of the event, magnitude of the event, etc.  To accurately estimate these statistics, we take advantage of the Law of Large numbers; whenever studying stochastic events, the larger the number of random samples you can simulate, the more confident you can be in the value of the statistics of the sample.  We require a large number of Monte Carlo samples to estimate rare event probabilities.  The approach taken in this is to generate stochastic catalogs, where a year's worth of natural disasters are simulated ten thousand to one-hundred thousand times.  "

    "Now that we can quickly read in our entire dataset into the specified form, we need to actually compute the statistics of the catalog.  Specifically, we will be generating a loss table, which aggregates all of the estimated GroundUpLosses that occur during a particular calatog year.  Since we have 10,000 catalog years in this particular catalog, the loss table will have 10K entries.  This type of analysis requires creating subsets of the original dataset, and aggregating certain parts of a particular column based on the value of another column.  In the end, we would like to convert our three column dataframe with 2557951 rows into a two column dataframe with 10K rows.  Each row should contain the sum of Ground up losses for a particular catalog year and a particular spatial resolution and location.  For example, to build a loss table for StateID = 48, we only want to sum GroundUpLosses that occur in that particular state, and ignore all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a type of data analysis that you should perform using Numpy arithmatic, because it cannot be easily vectorized.  Instead, this is the exact situation that a pivot table was created for.  A pivot table is a small table that summarizes the results contained in a larger dataset.  These summary statistics can be any valid statistic that describes the data contained in the subset of interest.   Because we are taking a large dataset and reducing it, the statistical function we select is called the aggregation function, which is simply a way of grouping rows of a dataframe together and computing a single summary value for those rows. Pandas has an efficient implementation of pivot tables, pivot_table, that we can take advantage of.\n",

    "Looking at the above plot, we can se that the stochastic catalog approaches the convergence criterion fairly quickly on average, and even the second standard deviation from the mean approaches convergence quickly as well.  However, one should be careful when thinking about this result, because the plots are unlikely to be normally distributed due to the truncation of the coefficient of variation at one and at zero.  Looking at the \"error bars\", we can see that these bounds are violated by the standard deviation.  Instead, let's look at the percentage of states whose catalogs have converged by a particular year."

    "The above plot shows the percentage of states whose catalog has converged by YearID.  It is a very odd looking plot, but it provides useful information and some insight into the convergence criterion itself.  The first thing to note: roughly twenty percent of our catalog meets the convergence criterion after just a few years.  Unfortunately, that percentage almost immediately drops to zero.  This underscores the statistical nature of the coefficient of variation.  For each year, we are estimating the coefficient of variation from a set of random samples.  If the random samples themselves change, then the estimate of the coefficient of variation will change as well.  This variation may cause the coefficient to oscillate above and below the threshold for convergence.  Thus, adding a new datapoint by considering an additional year may change our belief about the catalog's convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we only have 13 states, which is a fairly small sample size for estimating the percentage of states converged.  In addition, the coefficient of variation is a function of YearID.  It is likely to be highly sensitive to the data at low YearID counts, due to the limited datasize.  As the number of years in the catalog increase, we should expect the variability to decrease due to the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets bundle this analysis into a function so that we can analyze the convergence by county."

    "Above, we have repeated our analysis from the 10K catalog using the 100K catalog.  In the original set, convergence was reached prior to YearID 10,000.  The process for constructing the catalog is stochastic, so the event generation is random.  As a result, there will be some variability due to the stochastic nature of the simulation.  However, if the catalog was truely converged by YearID 10,000, then we would expect that any catalog that extends past 10,000 years should converge as well.  We should be careful when reading the phrase \"any catalog ...\"  Specifically, I mean that any random repetition of the same sampling procedure should be of similar quality to the catalog that we just studied.  That means considering the same states, the same climate, and the same peril.  A 10K catalog for atlantic hurricanes may converge for the eastern cost of the united states, however it may not converge for earthquakes on the east coast.  This analysis specifically applies to the simulation that we are currently considering.\n",

    "To underscore this point, let us consider the convergence of the same catalog by county, rather than by state."

    "The analysis by county starts off promising, roughly 90 % of the catalog has converged by year 2!  However, looking at both the plot and the table, we see that this initial optimism is simply noise.  As the sample size grows, the trend starts to become clear: the percentage of counties that reach convergence starts very low, and steadily increases with YearID.  Unfortunately, this steady increase stops at a very low value.  Roughly 97 percent of the catalog fails to converge by 10,000 years.\n",

An event that occurs once every 10 years will be expected to occur 1,000 times in a 10K catalog.  Of course, the random nature of the process means that a specific catalog may only have 950 of those events occur.  If that occurs, we would estimate the event probability as 0.095 rather than the actual value of 0.1.  Let's check the relative error."

However, if we consider an event that occurs only once every twenty thousand years, we might not even get a single event in our catalog to estimate that probability.  In addition, the variance of our estimate is likely to be large due to the relatively small sample size.  \n",

    "This gives us a chance to reflect on what has changed from the state based analysis to the county based analysis: the spatial extent of a county versus a state.  For now, consider hurricanes that impact Richland County in the state of South Carolina.  Because Richland county is contained in the state of South Carolina, any hurricane that impacts Richland county also impacts South Carolina.  However, there are many possible hurricane paths that would impact South Carolina without crossing the boundary of Richland county.  Thus, the probability of a hurricane striking Richland County is smaller than the probability of a hurricane striking South Carolina.\n",
    "\n",
    "By considering a smaller spatial resolution, we are attempting to estimate much smaller probabilities using the same random sampling procedure.  The sample size used to estimate those rare event probabilities needs to be increased in order to have any confidence in our estimates.  So, let's repeat our analysis on the 100K catalog and see how much of an impact the larger sample size will make."
